### Python-codes
This repository contains python scripts:
 - health_log.py: This script will create and maintain the diet log files and exercise log files of different individuals.
   
 - guess_the_number.py: As the name suggests, the user must enter a number and try to find out the secret number in maximum 10 attempts.
   
 - healthy_programmer.py: This script reminds a programmer to drink water (every 35 mins), do eye exercises (every 30 mins), and perform physical activity (every 45 mins) during work hours (9am-5pm).
                          The program:
                             a. Play audio reminders until the user confirms completion ("drank" for water, "eydone" for eyes, "exdone" for physical).
                             b. Maintain log completion times in separate files for each activity.
                             c. Manage overlapping reminders, so they don't play simultaneously.

- stone_paper_scissor.py: This Python program brings the classic game of Stone-Paper-Scissors to life! You'll face off against the computer in a 10-round battle, rekindling your childhood memories.
                          The age-old rules apply: stone crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers stone. Player with maximum points will win.
